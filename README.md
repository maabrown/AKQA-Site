# Mark Brown II - AKQA Code Submission

This is my submission for AKQA. I hope that you enjoy!

### Tech

I used the following technology to build my sample site:

* [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com/) - MVC Framework
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
* [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) - For responsive design checking
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [BEM](http://getbem.com/) - Naming methodology

### Installation

The app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/maabrown/AKQA-Site.git
$ cd AKQA-Site
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Point your browser to localhost:8080 (unless you change the port number)

You can stop the app by Pressing CTRL+C


### Notes

 - I chose to not use jQuery because I felt that I was not using it enough to justify using it. I bring this up because I make an API call for the 'products.json' file using traditional vanilla Javascript. I want you to know that this was a choice rather than a demonstration of a lack of experience with jQuery. (This same choice includes using the includes() and map() functions - both exist in jQuery but I used vanilla JavaScript instead).
 - I have changed the layout of the information of the site depending on the responsive technology you are using to view the site (mobile, tablet, desktop).
 - I have included a source map with my repo since my styles.min.css file, which is linked in the header, is minified. This will allow you to take a deeper look into my style choices.


Thank you for your time and taking a look!

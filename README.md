# Mark Brown II - AKQA Code Submission

This is my submission for AKQA. I hope that you enjoy!

### Tech

I used the following technology to build my sample site:

* [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com/) - MVC Framework
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript Library.
* [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) - For responsive design checking
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend


### Installation

The app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/maabrown/AKQA-Site.git
$ cd AKQA-Site
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Point your browser to localhost:8080 (unless you change the port number)

You can stop the app by Pressing CTRL+C

Thank you for your time and taking a look!
